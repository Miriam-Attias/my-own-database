# My-Own-DB

## Goal

The goal of this project is to use a fully operational self-made database.

## Description

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables. In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key. The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.

This system is like real relational database. you can do all CRUD operations by using the functions - create tables, update them, add columns, write queries and more. 
I worked on generic API suitable for differing relational and non-relational functionalities and pre-written test cases.

enjoy!
